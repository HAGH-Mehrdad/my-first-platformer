New game button => difficulty selection UI

All difficulty buttons change to skin selection UI

The select button in Skin Selection UI will navigate the UI to the next UI (level UI) BUT only if the skin is selected (purchased)
	=> it is done through UI_SkinSelection.cs, accessing UI_MainMenu.cs and UI_LevelCreation.cs
	=> the difficulty selection should navigate to the level selection UI
	=> note here to avoid null reference exception is to pass a true while Getting component of level creation. this is because 

Only thing is left is to pass the last difficulty to the continue button
this means we need to save the difficulty when we select the level dedicated to the level selection UI
	=> save the difficulty when loading the level(UI_levelButton.cs)
	=> Load difficulty method in DifficultyManager.cs 
	=> Load the difficulty type in the main menu, continue button
