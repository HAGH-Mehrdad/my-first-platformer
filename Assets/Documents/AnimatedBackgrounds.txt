ANIMATED BACKGROUND

- we create an animated bc with a 3d object
- and the material image on this 3d object creates an illusion of animated bc by reaping.
- THIS 3D OBHECT IS "QUAD"
- quad scale is 4
- quad position (z) must be behind the foreground
- for changing the color of the quad we must create a material and add it to the quad game object
- this will change the default material with background material and we can use unlit/texture as shader.
- we add our pictures of bc as texture.
- for every background pics we should change their wrap mode to repeat in order to use offset to animate them.
- Now we create a script and by accessing to mesh renderer component we change the offset
