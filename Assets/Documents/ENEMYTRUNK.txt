ENEMY TRUNK

- the setup until creating the script is easy and like other steps of the enemy 
- Basically the trunk behaves like mushroom except he stops moving when he detects the player and starts shooting.
** Check the bullet's layer **

- The problem I have is the enemy attacks with a delay [even walks then it detects the player] 
	=> solved by adding attack cool down to attack method (when the enemy wants to attack, resets the idle timer to a duration plus a cool down)

-The next problem is that the bullet doesn't change direction when the enemy changes direction
