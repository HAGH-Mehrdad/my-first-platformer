ENEMY SNAIL

- setting up the object and animator
- setting the snail behavior to act like mushroom that transfer to shell mode after being hit and die after hitting again.
-creating another script for the snail for killing the snail itself.
	=> we want rotation and velocity,
	=> added it to the snail body object
	=> we have to create a variable that can be assigned snail body prefab
- Set up movement for the shell when the player hit it for the second time
