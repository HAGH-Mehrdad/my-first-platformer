MobileControl

This is for movement and jump button
- the right side is for all jump functions
- the left side is for joystick (package name: joystick pack b Fenerax studio)

These two objects are added to UI_InGame

for jump button we added a button and on its script, it should have a reference to the player.
	 it also inherits from IPointerDownHandler. in its interface it tells the player to call the jump button.

for joystick we should add variable joystick prefab and can change to float joystick type
	in addition we find the first object of joystick in player's script and change the x,y input values 
	NOTE: I commented x,y input value of keyboard because it won't work. I'll undo them in case of testing with keyboard
