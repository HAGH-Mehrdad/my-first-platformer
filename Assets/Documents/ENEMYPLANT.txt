ENEMY PLANT

Like other classes of enemies, this class should inherit from Enemy.cs

- We override the update method
- Implemented attack method. (Plays attack animation)
- we override the HandleAnimation method but we don't call base method to prevent getting handling movement animation warning ( anim.setFloat("xVelocity", rb.linearVelocityX);
- attack is executing after the animation is over immediately. we need some sort of delay (routine) for plant to attack after a certain amount of time.
	=> this was accomplished with checking the last time enemy attacked in the attack method and checking if it can attack in update method. 
- Now we want to instantiate the bullet
	=> create a class that have access to rigid body
	=> we declared some of bullet functionality and setting the velocity public so we can use it in animation event

(-0.939 , 0.131) the position of the bullet when shooting from the plant

- We need to flip the plant where we want to place it in a very easy approach. 
	=> just right click on the plant script and use the flip item
