Enemy Chicken
9th minute

Enhancing chicken movement [detecting the player and flipping with delay]

What data types do we need for chicken?
- a float duration for aggro
- a timer for aggro
- a Boolean that indicates if it detects the enemy
- a float that indicates enemy detection range
- a layer mask that detects the player


CHIKEN
- Stop the chicken aggression when it does not detect the player, additionally we want to stop it when it doesn't detect the wall and ledge 
	=> canMove = false in turn around method

- Turns to player if the player jumps over the chicken 
	=> declare player ref in enemy and update its position every seconds with Invoke repeating.
	=> passing player position in Handle Flip method. The function needs to pass a variable
	=> handle flip method is in handle movement and the flip compares whether the player is on the left or right of the enemy
- The enemy will die easily when you pass it. chicken should go more distance before flipping (flip with a bit of a delay)
