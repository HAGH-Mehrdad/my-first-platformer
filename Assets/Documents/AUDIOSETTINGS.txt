AUDIO SETTINGS
- This game object will not be destroyed on changing levels or dying. (singleton) 
public static AudioManager instance; // singleton reference

	=> static means itâ€™s shared across all instances of this class.
	   It allows any other script to access the AudioManager using:
	   AudioManager.instance.Play("Jump"); (for example).

- we declare an array of sfx in AudioSource class in which we can call the sfx by their index
- adding manually the sound to the buttons we need to play by calling audio manager instance which is static and then the method play
