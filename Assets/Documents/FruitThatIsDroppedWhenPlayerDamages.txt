FruitThatIsDroppedWhenPlayerDamages

This script contains some important issues.

- the for each loop works like this: when the fruit is dropped it starts blinking fast and then slow. (the parameters of float that I have passed is 0.1 blinking to 0.5 secs)

-The reason fruit stays the same color is that Color.white means “don’t tint, fully visible.”
	If you want true blinking with transparency only, you should keep the original RGB and adjust only the alpha channel.
	(in the second Toggle method of co-routine in the mentioned script.)
